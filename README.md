---
This prototype aims is to provide a cheap own made portable air cooler system.

The idea is to automatically start a ventilator on a hermetic bowl when the temperature is above a limit.

The bowl is full of ice and has a hole with a tube: the air from ventilator should produces a fresh air for your room.
